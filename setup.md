<!-- Why we created the __init__.py file  -->
in the src folder there is the folder mcq_generator inside it there are several files regarding the project and to consider it as a package there is a standard to add this file.

<!-- run 
pip install -r requirement.txt 
this will create a folder containing all the information regarding your local package-->
