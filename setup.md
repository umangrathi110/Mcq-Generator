# MCQ Generator using OpenAI and Langchain

## Steps

### Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### Step 2: Experimentation in Jupyter Lab

Explore and experiment with the project in Jupyter Lab. This step involves creating and testing various ideas and functionalities.

### Step 3: Modular Coding

Convert the experiments and code into modular components for better organization and maintainability.

### Step 4: Creating Web API using Streamlit

Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly web interface for the MCQ generator.

### Step 5: Deploy Application on Cloud Platform (AWS)

Deploy the finalized application on a cloud platform such as AWS to make it accessible to users.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the MCQ generator.
  - `mcq_generator/`: Package folder containing various files related to the project.
    - `...`: Additional subfolders and files as required.

- `experiments/`: Holds Jupyter Notebook files for experimentation and development.



#### Why we created the __init__.py file
in the src folder there is the folder mcq_generator inside it there are several files regarding the project and to consider it as a package there is a standard to add this file.
